pipeline / A simple way to plan your work week
==============================================
***

## DESCRIPTION

We all have busy lives. We need a way to help us focus on what to work on for a given week without a lot of work maintaining a system.

Pipeline allows you to plan your work week by splitting up hours between projects. Time is recorded against these projects using Freshbooks or Harvest (systems you already use to track your time).

Emails are sent to you throughout the week to help you keep focus.

This repository is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) site[^1] where I am blogging my path in creating a new SASS application. Along the way people can expect to hear about my personal challenges 
in getting the application launched, the revenue figures, code and technical issues, and everything in between. Join me on my ride.
